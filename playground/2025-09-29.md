SPEAKER 1
No, no, it's okay. It's working. It's okay. Hold on.

SPEAKER 2
Yeah.

SPEAKER 1
All right.

SPEAKER 2
How are you doing anyway?

SPEAKER 1
Oh, yeah, good. Yeah, good, good, good. I think just sorting out this focus for MVP we wanted to do. It was a pain in the ass, but I sorted out. I made some mistakes in the tech stack, but at least we can now build MVPs really fast now.

SPEAKER 2
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

SPEAKER 1
Anyway, oh, man, like I said, I'm not really a soft engineer. I'm just using AI to do everything, right? I don't know. Like, because, you know, whenever you ask me anything, you know, what's my first response? Why didn't you ask ChatGPT? Why do you even ask me, right? Like, what email service you might use, right? Ask ChatGPT, because that's literally what I did. Once I saw your email. Yeah, because I don't even, you know, like, I mean, I do, but then I already know it's going to be Microsoft or Google, but then I just gather all my intelligence from ChatGPT. But anyway, you know, I can build any software. Like I said, it just takes some time right now, but then honestly, like I said, I can build any software under the sun. Literally, I'm not even kidding, right? I can't imagine C+ Java, whatever you call it, whatever language I reckon to be, you kind of builds, right?

SPEAKER 2
Yeah. Yeah. The thing is, though, right? For email, I was just thinking, because it's probably get unlimited emails. I don't know if I should use, I don't know, if I should just use for Microsoft. So tell me, like, from your perspective, why is it better to use Microsoft and Google instead of, right?

SPEAKER 1
So number one thing. No, no. So I'll tell you what's the reason why we have to use Microsoft because your team in China, apparently your ERP is connected to the email server as well. So sometimes you're going to send transactional emails. Anyway, you should use Cloudflare for this. But it's not really a problem. But because if you do that, you guys need to spend a ton of time changing your tech stack and obviously you can't use, you know, they're not using AI to change the tech stack, so you just have to follow what they do, right? Has to be Microsoft then. The reason why you should, because I also talked to a few people in Lynx team, they all have trouble sending emails to certain clients in the UK. The reason why is because Yandex is using server associated with Russia and UK, as you can expect, pretty anti-Russia right now, so I think that's the reason. But the budget for changing the Microsoft is going to be 10 bucks a month per user. And I did a quick math. It's going to be around 10 users for my pack. My pack.com, you're gonna need 10. So it's gonna be 100 bucks per month.

SPEAKER 2
Yeah. Yeah.

SPEAKER 1
No, it's fine. Okay. Good, good. Listen, the whole painful thing about this is that because you've been using your index for like 10 years, the whole backup migration and whatever DevOps perspective is going to be a pain in the ass, right? It's going to be gigabytes of data, I don't know, 500 gigabytes, whatever, of data to backup and migrate. Your IT is supposed to do it? But I don't think they know how to do it. So it's either going to be me doing it or I don't know. I don't think you're going to have time to do it. So if I do it, it's going to be days. Honestly, it's going to take days of work. To do the backup migration because it's 500 gigabytes and you don't want to mess up things, right?

SPEAKER 2
Yeah.

SPEAKER 1
And I just, I don't know the complexity. But I can imagine it's gonna be pretty painful because I don't even know why you even use the index from the first space. No one in the world uses the index, okay? No, how is the index free? I'm pretty sure you're paying, right? Aren't you paying for custom domain?

SPEAKER 2
No, it's free.

SPEAKER 1
Oh, really? It's free? Okay. Yeah, but now it becomes a pain in the ass to migrate because I know companies that switch from Google to Microsoft. And they literally spent a month doing that. Like I know cash rewards, I know their CR and he was telling me about them switching from Google to Microsoft and took them a month doing that once they become a large business. Sorry, say it again. I actually can't hear you. Your mark is too far. No, I couldn't hear you. Your microphone is too far away.

SPEAKER 2
Yeah.

SPEAKER 1
I mean, I've actually spent quite a bit of time on the whole BI APS or whatever in my pack, and I'm taking a pause right now, just working on Kevork and also hiring, I guess, as well. I'm trying to post ads across all the unis in the region because I can actually sign up employer accounts. Like I wanted to get someone to do all the administrative work for me, but then no one's really gonna do the groundwork for me, right? So I just have to do it myself. Like, you know what I feel right now? I'm just doing too much groundwork. Sorry, say it again. So KevUp right now. So, coming up right now, what I'm really having difficulties is just getting the exact product because these people, I mean, even from George or whatever, they only have a very small number of SKUs available that's certified, right? So they only have two taps on the watermark or they only have one window for shelling standards like AS 20047. Standards. Like the problem with this is that, you know, like these distributors, they also only hold a very small number of these products. So, like, if, even if we go out, we're not going to have a huge number of products to show the people. That's, that's the problem. And what I'm really doing right now is that I'm trying to Sorry, say it again.

SPEAKER 2
Is there any way to get that number up?

SPEAKER 1
That's what I'm trying to find out right now because what I'm really doing right now, I'm actually trying to find the registry and I'm trying to find all the factories that have received certification or lab reports from the standards. And I'm trying to go for the manufacturers directly to get their account locked. That's what I'm trying to do. Like that's actually the only way, right? Because I think the angle for us, right, is not to be like George, because George just sells anything. But what we are really focusing on is to be the pre-certified SKUs. So every product on our platform, it's pre-certified and ready to go, essentially. But the problem is that they're expensive. They're a lot more expensive than what it can expect from George's price. Yeah, because you think about it, like if a manufacturer already has certified all these, it's very expensive to get them certified. Their price is almost double the price and then sell them to Australia. So that's a tricky part, right? We do the certification ourselves, costs a lot of money and we just select SKU. But then right now we don't have any distribution, right? Like I don't know, Honestly, I look at everything right. I don't really know what's gonna be the star product. What's the most perfect product to go? Because we don't have distribution. I just don't know, like, which one we should go for.

SPEAKER 2
Yeah. So at the moment, we don't have a lot of products. And we don't really have a single way of getting our products. No.

SPEAKER 1
No, no, no. But obviously that's difficult part of this business, right? If it's easy then, you know, it's like drop shipping. Everyone has started a long time ago because, you know, it's not easy. That's why if we crack the problem, we got a business, right? But it feels like a very difficult problem to crack. And I guess the problem I have is I feel like we're going for you know what we do for Arctic is that we have, we're trying to find a product to sell rather than going from a demand, like, you know, find people, find a demand and then fulfill the demand, right? Like, I feel like we're just trying to find, find a supply for it and, yeah, like, I also think it's kind of a pain in the ass to find a supply for it, too. By the way, quickly, the baracuda, I guess, is dead. Like the weird guy. He's never getting back to us, right?

SPEAKER 2
Yeah.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, yeah. I think the core problem with us is that we actually aren't in the business of this. We're just outsiders, right? But I think it's fine. It's completely fine because we're just building this using AI. And it's fine to be an outsider and trying to come in and do the business. But it's actually, you know what I think is really the most perfect way to do this business? Is actually to partner with the builder and actually to solve all their problems with them. And then we basically as Kevob, we do all the discovery process with this business and we source everything for them almost for free over three months. And then at the end, we pretty much got a business. But then we had to find a partner to do this with.

SPEAKER 2
Yeah. I'll be watching these programs. My kids recently told undercover billionaire.

SPEAKER 1
No, I haven't heard of it.

SPEAKER 2
What is it?

SPEAKER 1
I'll look it up.

SPEAKER 2
I am very confident that I can take my $100.

SPEAKER 1
All right, I've heard it, I've heard it. Yeah, by flipping cars, right? Right, right, by flipping cars. Yeah.

SPEAKER 2
No, no, no, doing all sorts of stuff, right?

SPEAKER 1
Yeah.

SPEAKER 2
But I asked myself to be able to turn my $100 into a million dollars in 90 days, right? Yeah. I thought it was gonna be like one of those bullshit programs, like, you know, with all of that. I actually breaking a tool, like obviously part of it is right? But actually I reckon a large part of it is actually legit, right? Yeah, I actually find it really fascinating. I think you're cool.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, oh no, I've actually seen clips of it but then I thought it was so boring because the few clips I've seen they're just flipping cars. They're trying to buy a $3,000 Jeep or sell for 10 grand, that's what I saw. But it's definitely this show though.

SPEAKER 2
Obviously, anything to do with, even though you're gonna make a TV program, obviously they need to edit it for viewers and stuff like that. But of course they're always complaining. I mean, you know, you want to make your TV program after all, right? But, you know, I think it is pretty good, like, you know, in terms of, you know, at least, at least for my kids, I think it's pretty good. But I think it's actually good for anyone to watch, right? Because you do look at it and you actually do learn a lot.

SPEAKER 1
Because one of the cool things I thought was from the show was that everyone just was, you know, like the best guy in sales. Everyone was saying that, you know, they can sell anything, right? Because that's how they make money. Because $100 to be, you just need to be.

SPEAKER 2
I've only finished watching episode two, right? Right. I haven't really, I haven't watched enough to really say, so there are two things that I thought were, really interesting, right? First of all, I think it's interesting how the guy clearly had, you know, while he could do the rags to riches, he grew up in poverty or whatever, from a very simple beginning, and now he's working to be. But I think the interesting thing was how he actually doesn't have any monetizing skills to go from 100 to say 10,000. You know what I mean? I'll give you an example. If he was a barista, If he was on a chef, if he was a really good cleaner or anything, you know what I mean? Those are the skills that can take you from zero to 10,000 really fast. Right? But he had a really good, what was really good to me, in my mind, was his mindset. So, like, it obviously would have been like, he actually genuinely did go through hardship through it, and it was so easy for someone to tap out of it. I like the fact that he actually persisted and he kept a positive mindset even though most people just thought, what the f*** am I doing here? They would have gotten out of that. You could tell it was pretty s*** for him. When you watch the first few episodes, you realize he's pretty bloody miserable for a guy who goes from a feeling of lifestyle to f***ing speaking in his car and eating Mr. Noodle. Trying to make these first 100 episodes go to distance. But I was very impressed. I'll see what, right? What would I notice that? Him and normal people, right? His decision making was sharp, right? Even though he wasn't any fun, he's 56 years old, right? But he was making good decisions on the spot. Like a lot of people that I noticed, right? I can usually tell the difference between someone who I think is going to be successful in their life, or someone who is successful, even if you take away all their money, their decision making is spot on. Whereas a lot of people, like, and I have this problem, I don't remember I spoke to someone very successful once when I was in Netherlands, right? And he said to me, and this guy's worth hundreds of millions, right? He said to me, I remember he said to me when I was young, he said, one of the things that you're going to learn is you want to make three tests or you need to make decisions faster, right? And that stuck with me. I realized that when I actually see people and I put them on the spot, like I remember I was talking to someone the other day and I was like, look, if you want, like, I don't know, I was trying to get rid of some furniture and something like that. I just said to him, well, you want or not, right? Oh, they're jelly dialing. And I was like, that's the whole thing. I can't stand that. You know, I was giving you the option. You're either going to take it or not. Like, when you watch the guy in the show, you could just say he just makes decisions and he moves fast. He doesn't do his daily. He makes decision and he pushes the edges.

SPEAKER 1
You're right.

SPEAKER 2
I think that that was very smart.

SPEAKER 1
I agree.

SPEAKER 2
But you can see he's throwing a lot of pizza up against the wall, but he's making decisions fast. He's going forward. He's not, like, around. You know, arming and arming on decision.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, yeah. Because the energy, I wanted to give, right? It's actually about the speed of execution, like speed of making decisions. So you only make 10 decisions, even if you get eight of them correct, and you come to someone who makes 100 decisions, and when you get 60 of them correct, the guy who makes 100 decisions, I want to get 60 correct, still makes 60 correct decisions, right? And that's still better than only making six decisions, like eight decisions, right?

SPEAKER 2
So.

SPEAKER 1
And the funny part is that actually reminds me of your, of your dad, right? Because he was the one telling me, oh, you guys couldn't make our decision for Guan Siew Factory. And he just comes in and say, oh, let's do this, let's do that. Within a day, then he's made all the decisions, right?

SPEAKER 2
Yeah, that's right. Yeah. And my dad, he's very good at making those decisions. And he makes him fast and he goes through it sometimes a little bit too fast. You know what I mean? Like, he doesn't like a, like, you know, he doesn't, he doesn't wait around. You know what I mean? Like, you know, I'm not being an hour about it either. And so, yeah, it was the fact that, yeah, but he didn't have any. And I also, like, he had this thing, right? He goes, my immediate thing is I need to make, I need to make, like, I can't remember what his number was. And he goes, I need to make three, four thousand dollars a month. Right. I need to get in a month, so I don't have to worry about my living expenses for the next three months. Right? Right. Because he goes, I can't, I've got 90 days to build a business. I can't build a business, but I'm worrying about how to like where to sleep and where my next meal is. So he first is, I need to get rid of all those kind of like, like, I think factors once they're all met, then I'll focus on my business. Right?

SPEAKER 1
Right.

SPEAKER 2
And what I realized, right, is, oh yeah, and probably the last thing that I thought was very good, right, but he had this little discipline about it. And he said, my first rule of business is find a need, fill a need, right? So it has to be customer-led, right? So he was looking around online around, you know, who are the people like in the learning training, like what are things people want to buy, what are things worth a lot of money that I can buy and things like that. And he immediately was thinking about how can I get people to, yeah, how can I get people, how can I find what the market needs right now? And he was just like, and he goes, oh, you say, you know, people want to buy top tires. He wasted a whole bunch of time trying to find top tires, right? If I can just find 30 top tires that people are throwing away, that'll give me enough money to kind of, you know, do what I need to do. Right? He's like, If I right now 100-1355, that's going to get me to my $3,300 that I need to get through my life insurance and that's what I'm going to focus on. Things like laser focus on finding 13 truck tax truck tires. Right, right.

SPEAKER 1
And do he make money?

SPEAKER 2
Well, after one or two days you couldn't find any truck tires, you guys went into finding like 10 t-shirts, because when he had said something, we went back to the trust side, right? You didn't just tell, like, he, he was staying focused that he had in his agenda, but every time after 1-2 days, you couldn't find a good move. You know what I mean? But his focus is always getting on that number, 3300, then he gets 3200. And then he had his number. And then he goes, oh, I want to get in, like, in the second episode, he decides he wants to go into the craft beer business. Right? Look, and this is one of those things when it comes to decision making. So you, you watch it for yourself and see what you get. But this is one of my takeaways from it, right? He has no key. He only has like fifteen hundred dollars in his name. But you had to talk to a lawyer about what the licensing to get to do the class view business. Right. And this will give you an idea around the decision making. Right. Yeah. And if you work hard, finally found three tires or two or three tires, finally got some money. He finally had enough to pay back. Right. And then he wrote, all right, he did his research. I didn't go into craft into the craft beer business and to talk to a lawyer around how to get licensing before it just specializes in, in, in beer, like, in our boys, licensing team. Yeah. Right. Because. Cory won a thousand dollars up front just to have a 10 minute conversation with him.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah.

SPEAKER 2
And he bought fine. And he just spent that thousand dollars straight away.

SPEAKER 1
Wow.

SPEAKER 2
Now, to be honest, like for most people, it's hard to make yourself $1,500. It's not asking you a thousand dollars straight up just to have a conversation with a lawyer. No. Most people with won't be able to make that decision. Straight away. But he. But he just made that decision. He goes, look, I needed. I needed to figure it out. He paid the money and went to the research. Right? I was a little bit shocked when I saw that, but then I realized, because his immediate Focus was, I need to start earning again. Do you know what I mean? He didn't. I don't know. I see a lot of people, and they've reached junctures like that, and they can't take that turn. They say, painful for me. You know what I mean?

SPEAKER 1
Yeah.

SPEAKER 2
He immediately killed his craft beer idea. Immediately killed it.

SPEAKER 1
After the. After spending $1000 dollars.

SPEAKER 2
Yeah. Yeah. So I told him it's going to take you about four months just to get the license. And he goes, oh, right. So that's out. You know what I mean?

SPEAKER 1
Yeah.

SPEAKER 2
And you might think that $1,000 is expensive, but a $1,000 could have saved you a lot of other money.

SPEAKER 1
Because time is money, man. Honestly, time is money. Every hour is worth, you know what I said? What I said? I was thinking about this the other day, right? I actually said to myself, I don't want to do anything, any work that's worth less than a thousand dollars an hour. Because saying my time is worth a million dollars a year, then I should not spend my time on any activities that's not worth a thousand dollars an hour. I should, like, I have to do the groundwork right now. I understand, right? I can't get anyone to do it, but then. If I'm worth a million dollars a year, right? I think I'm worth more, but then say I'm worth a million dollars, then your hourly activity, you should spend your time on activities that's worth more than a thousand dollars an hour, which are not doing email back up and migrations, right? That's not worth a thousand dollars an hour. So I just saw this analogy somewhere, right? I saw it interesting to share with you. It's relevant to this, I guess. But it's the kind of mindset, right? You don't want to do shit that's not worth a lot of money. You should do high value activities.

SPEAKER 2
That's right. That's right. Yeah. So anyway, it just strikes me through all of this that I realized overall, right? Yeah, it just strikes me overall when I look at all this sort of stuff that. Yeah. No. And so anyway, I'll be best place decision making, but I think the main thing to take away was actually, okay, so one stage, right? He's like, dead with the money, right? So he's talking to his business and they said, look, I'll pay you a really high commission to sell my dog ball, right? And this product, somebody has made this new dog ball product, patches that really nicely, right? And wherever you can sell, you can keep, like, 50. You get a 50 commission on it, right? On this dog ball. Right? And so he says, right, I'm the world. I'm a really good salesman. I'm a really good salesman.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, right.

SPEAKER 2
He's like, right, I need to sell 100 of these balls and I'll make bank, right? I'm gonna make five, five, five dollars profit a ball. I make five bucks a ball, right? So he went over there doing it, and then he ways to, I don't know, he went to a dog park. He's worked at 30 dog owners. I don't know if that's the exact number. That then. And he didn't make any sales. And he goes, I just broke my Cardinal rules. And that means I'll now be protected. He's giving me a product and telling me to sell it. And he was really upset at himself because I broke my card, my Cardinal rules. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because he thought, I'm going out there calling myself the world's best out, but I can sell anything, right? I can't even. Fucking sells like one single dog hole for 30 dog owners throughout the fucking park.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

SPEAKER 2
What the fuck am I doing saying I'm a sales man? So now I'm gonna fucking take, I'm gonna just take a product and sell it. And I thought that was really, I don't know, like you think about it, right? And that's a fucking hubris that a lot of us have, including myself. Oh, you're a fucking dad, man, I can sell anything, right? Before you realize it's not about something being good or not, right? You've gotta have the discipline and you've got to put up there, there's a market there.

SPEAKER 1
That's right. That's right. Because, yeah, that's right. Like, you're gonna. So what do he do?

SPEAKER 2
What.

SPEAKER 1
What do he end up? So he realizes that the product he was trying to sell is not the right product, and he could have. And then he realized, like, he need to find a better product to sell. Do he or what do he do?

SPEAKER 2
Well, right now, right now he's struggling like f*** trying to find his distance. So he's going in a coffee shop, you know, all that sort of stuff. And he's trying to figure out where is the market demand in the market. Like, because this market, what if this market needs to be coffee shops in the memory, but yeah, he's trying to be market. So he's three funded with the one of the high growth sectors in the area, right? And he's going to focus on those high growth sectors.

SPEAKER 1
Right, right, right, right.

SPEAKER 2
Yeah, he's got a very distinct timeline. He needs to make a million dollars in 90 days, right? Yeah. So he's on the extreme time compression and he has to focus on very short term wins, right? Like, you know, literally, like you said, you know, you break it down, right? You need to roughly in the first 30 days, like, you're thinking of the general multiple. You want to make at least 10,000 with those 38s. If you get 100,000 by 60, I think it's 10 months per million, you know, from 100,000 million in the last 30. That would be the very minimum, right? But he's finding it really hard just to get to the first 10,000. Of course.

SPEAKER 1
Of course.

SPEAKER 2
And then, like, but he said, like, but, like, you know, Just look at the way that he's doing it and it's thought out. Like, you know, first of all, he's going to the market and then what he's doing, he's putting job ads out and he's actually saying to these people, I don't have any money to pay you. Right? He's interviewing a lot of people and said, would you like to work for Sweat Equity? I don't have any money. So he has to get them really excited by this to want to be part of SF Equity. Right, right, right. It knocks out 80 of people, right? It knocks out 80 of people that are interested in it. But people are gonna be sitting all these cameras following him around. They know he's not a nobody. But he's wearing like his Montclair. Yeah.

SPEAKER 1
Because if we go there, it's not going to be as, as high as. It's not gonna be 80. It's gonna be 99.9, by the way. I know for sure.

SPEAKER 2
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. So, you know, there are a lot of, like, good people that came through that seem really good. But I just said, look, i'll get, i'll get, i'll get three kids and a wife and another mob. I just can't. Right. A lot of the people just said they can't. Right. But, you know, if it's the way some people, you know, that need to stick around for it, but, you know, she's basically just trying. Okay. He's not really thinking long. He doesn't give you care because, like, 90 equity. Right. He needs, I mean, obviously he needs to get his graduation up to make. Million dollars. But, you know, without people, you. But what I realized is actually, to be honest, in today's day and age, how many people do you actually need in your business? Right?

SPEAKER 1
Oh, five. I knew five. Yeah, yeah.

SPEAKER 2
They can do me somebody. Right? You need. You do want some constant bodies, right? You want to have this bad kag of like, you want to suck with like five seconds, go. That'll be pretty miserable.

SPEAKER 1
That's right. That's right. So, yeah.

SPEAKER 2
That'S all I'm saying. You want to find it at the very least in my part of entertaining. You're gonna find it pretty painful to watch in some. In some stages, but it's actually pretty good. You know what I mean? It does make you. It does make you think about your first principles in terms of what we're trying to do, right? Because I think that giving yourself a timeline, even if it's artificial, I just say, I need to make a million dollars in the next 90 days, I think it's a good thing to run at. And I think if you watch it, you know, as I said to my kids out of it, you should f***ing decide what your phone is for 90 days and how you would do it better than you.

SPEAKER 1
So why don't we have it? I mean, we should have it for ourselves, but I so, so, so, so, I mean, what's the one we should have? I guess we should just have one for.

SPEAKER 2
He put a gun to my head and said, like, I. So I did. I said that there's two things. I spent. I spent a bit of time. I spent about half an hour an hour in Gemini.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah.

SPEAKER 2
You know the reason why I prefer Gemini to.

SPEAKER 1
Oh, because I actually don't use it for everything. Are you thinking? Because that one is pretty fast. It's only like 20 seconds. Are you thinking? 10 minutes of query, right? But then if you have really important technical questions, it's good. Yeah, but you're not supposed to use that. You're not supposed to use for everything. You're only supposed to use it for really difficult technical problems. So you solve like an engineering problem, but then for daily queries, you should thinking medium. Not even thinking high. Thinking medium.

SPEAKER 2
Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, anyway, I was just on it. And I actually reckon there's two ways to quickly. So actually the one way that I came up with is you probably want to stick your sales, right? But for sales, what I would have done if I was him, I would have actually just stuck to fix the working phone, right? Where what you're doing is you're getting a business and you're just working the phone for it.

SPEAKER 1
Okay? Okay.

SPEAKER 2
Because that's going to be the fastest way that you're going to drop my sales in any business, right? So say if you're going to do like, for example, furniture. I'm sorry. Or say you're going to go into building materials. The fastest way that you're going to get a lot of people is working the phone.

SPEAKER 1
I agree. I agree.

SPEAKER 2
So if you want to drum up cash fast, that's what you want to do. But you just want to get a long list of a lot of people and you just want to have them. You want to make like 200 phone calls a day. That's going to be that. I don't think there's going to be anything faster than that. I couldn't come up with dancing faster.

SPEAKER 1
If you only have 100 bucks right now, you do this, right?

SPEAKER 2
Right.

SPEAKER 1
How would I make a million dollars? Say I have 100 bucks, right? I don't know. 100 bucks.

SPEAKER 2
Yeah.

SPEAKER 1
You can barely get two meals. So you can't really slip in a hotel. You have to sleep on a car. All right, I'll have a thing. I don't know if it's, yeah, let me have a thing too. But reality is making money is still, everything's gonna be sales, man. Trust me, like making money requires sales, getting a job, you know what people say? No, no, no, listen, like I think the difference is that you think about sales, getting a job is also sales, by the way, because you're selling yourself. Everything sells, right?

SPEAKER 2
Yeah.

SPEAKER 1
Like everything requires sales.

SPEAKER 2
Michael said to me something that I think was good. Like he said, why doesn't he just get a job, you know, out of cash out, right? Or, you know, anyway, right? As a waiter or something like that to get money. Yeah, you know what? You could. And it would help you get your $10,000, you know, rank or something like that. I mean, maybe it would just be too boring for TV. But actually, you know what I mean? Like, you could be a drone pilot, flying drones around or something like that. You know what I mean? Like, there's plenty of little jobs that are behind paying.

SPEAKER 1
You could see a Western societies. Labor is so expensive, so you can make money everywhere. In Australia, US, I mean, not in China. Honestly, it's not going to work in China. Frankly, right? Because labor here is so cheap. Like, you can't make a million dollars doing this kind of stuff. You can barely make a living doing this kind of stuff.

SPEAKER 2
Yeah. Like, if you really want to, you could probably make 10, 000 a month if you really want it. Like, if you really, really want to, just by driving, like, Uber. You know what I mean? Maybe you'd have to, like, drive 20 hours a day. Yeah, it's super dedicated.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, and it's pretty high risk man, driving 20 hours a day, you're pretty much dizzy on the road, by the way, you're gonna be really tired. Yeah, and we crash, you know, it's like a junk bond, you know, you're making very minimal gangs and when you crash, it's 100% off, right off, right? Entire car is gone. Yeah, I don't think it's smart, it's not a good business. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

SPEAKER 2
There's a bunch of little things that you could do to get it. But nothing is going to kind of get you to that huge kind of, you know what I mean? I don't know. Remember I mentioned the agency, there's nothing like making 100 phone calls a day.

SPEAKER 1
And we said that from, I remember we said it literally the first time we talked, right? We're saying we're going to make 100 phone calls a day. And why aren't we doing that? I feel like we should do it literally today. Like, we should do it, I guess. We should. Literally tomorrow. I don't know. Like, what do you reckon? We should just do it. Okay. Okay. What I'm gonna really reckon is that I don't think we can just go on and say them. We lost everything. We should just pick a product or theory to start with. You know, it's literally like the million dollar, I don't know, the undercar billionaires. You pick one product to pitch to them. Like just find a window, maybe just double glazed windows. And then- okay, but do you know.

SPEAKER 2
What the problem is? You don't know these people and you only have one chip up your sleeve. If it's a no, it's a no. You know what I mean? It's really hard. You go back to the same person and oh, the next week, oh, now I've got this lighting. I think you were selling like, like, like, rebar lighting. You know what I mean? Credibility wise, it's really going to knock you out.

SPEAKER 1
Okay?

SPEAKER 2
I mean, okay.

SPEAKER 1
All right.

SPEAKER 2
You'd be better off being market led and talking to them. Say, what do you need? Right.

SPEAKER 1
I agree. This is what I'm gonna do, right?

SPEAKER 2
Great. You need kitchen? Kitchen's coming right up. Yeah, I need. I don't know. I need. I need reinforced walls done. Yeah.

SPEAKER 1
All right. You know what's my problem? My problem was that because making the website for Kevob has been so painful, I've been keep, I don't know, I just keep doing other stuff, right? I'm actually gonna set a timeline for myself, right? Over the next 15 hours, 12 hours, whatever. I'm not gonna do anything else. I fuck off everything. Sorry if your kids are around. I'm only gonna focus on getting the Kevob done and we're gonna start making from God smart. There's no excuses for me to not do that. I drop off everything.

SPEAKER 2
It's typically gonna be next week. Hey, Give me back. It's gonna be next week because I just so hard. I just wait.

SPEAKER 1
Oh, still.

SPEAKER 2
I can start. It doesn't mean 100. Yeah. All right.

SPEAKER 1
Because I keep going back to work on my pack stuff because they were just like.

SPEAKER 2
Dude, we already had one week. This is the second week already. What are you putting there? Did last week.

SPEAKER 1
So are you down next week or not? Are they going back to school next week or not? Are you back home now or are you still driving?

SPEAKER 2
But anyway, I'm just walking towards my son, guys.

SPEAKER 1
All right, so let's literally just make a decision on what is our proposition and let's just not bother. Let's, you know what? It's literally like the YC style companies, right? They change their bloody website every single day. They change the way they pitch, they change the way their entire value proposition every single day until they get product market fit. We are not, we don't even know what's like, I don't know what's our product market fit. We haven't talked to anyone. So literally we're going to do, which is pick one proposition.

SPEAKER 2
You just have to whack something together and then just say you've got a free market lead.

SPEAKER 1
Okay.

SPEAKER 2
You can't like micro. You have to tell all the time you're going to do.

SPEAKER 1
Oh, dude. Yeah, and reality is that I'm not even gonna bother trying to figure out the exact pictures and whatever for the products because it's so hard to get. We'll usually just put our marketing materials however we like, have a nice catalog, and then we just talk to these people until we get a deal.

SPEAKER 2
And then you figure out that we need to go play it.

SPEAKER 1
I'll go find it, but I can't find everything now. Yeah, I can't find everything right now. You're just so paying for the fun, everything right now. Yeah, and there's literally no excuses for us to not do this. Yeah, like let's literally become this whole mindset of this on a car, we just do it. Like if it's wrong, which is like, this is our dog ball, right? Now realize, oh shit, this is wrong. We're gonna source rebars, right? We're gonna source concrete.

SPEAKER 2
That's what I realized, right? That's what I realized, a lot of this sort of stuff, right? When we do this kind of stuff. Is. Yeah. Well, you know, if he. If he even had red side skills, I'd say he could have made maybe a few hundred dollars doing a wake up from small little business.

SPEAKER 1
Oh, yeah.

SPEAKER 2
Yeah.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah. At least I can be a software, right? Because I know I can be a software and it's worth quite a bit money, I guess, in the market.

SPEAKER 2
I didn't have any skills that amount of dollars, except I'm a good salesman.

SPEAKER 1
At least I can be an accountant, man.

SPEAKER 2
Yeah, but he did not have. Yeah, but he didn't have a single monetizable skill. But you realize that if you're even a website Builder, you'd be able to go from zero to a thousand plus an hour. Yeah.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah. Yeah. But he's like, I can be an accountant, but I choose not to be an accountant. It's so painful. I would never want to be an accountant, by the way. All right, so.

SPEAKER 2
Anyway, I think it's, if you do have a chance, I think, you know, if you have some downtime, you want to just chill out and relax, just watch it. I think it's, I think, you know, a lot of the stuff when I first watched it, I didn't really think much of it, but when I was like, just, I don't know, lying better or whatever, I thought about it.

SPEAKER 1
I'm too busy reading out of wall. I'm too busy reading out of wall.

SPEAKER 2
Yeah, a lot of the stuff you.

SPEAKER 1
Read, you don't really.

SPEAKER 2
Think about it. Actually, when you think about it, his decision-making was actually pretty good. Right, right. I realized she's gonna make a lot of bad mistakes. And like, when you're watching the show, you don't really think much of some stupid little decision he makes. What do you think about it? I was like, oh, but I thought about it like, I would have said, I couldn't have spent that thousand dollars like that, right? Yeah. Smart of him to do it. Or maybe it was a smart of him, but he wouldn't know until looking backwards, whether it was smart or not. You know what I mean? You might have that phone call and he might just tell you nothing new.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, by the way, you know, from a time perspective, making these kind of decisions was actually the only thing, like the only $1,000 per hour activity he could have done. Like what else could he, like he's not going to be a driver or be a waiter. The only one, like, like the activity that's worth $1,000 an hour is to do what he did, experimenting and pivoting, right? These skill sets, these activities are worth $1000 an hour because very few people in the world can do it, right? And that's exactly what we're gonna do. I think that's exactly what we're gonna do. We're gonna stop wasting our time on things that just don't worth money, that don't worth a lot of time value. We're gonna do something that's valuable. I'm not gonna, I'll literally reject, you know what I do? I'll literally reject so many things out of there. I only focus on what's gonna actually bring value, right? Just literally before you decide to do anything in the morning, think about is this activity worth $1,000 an hour? That's what I tell myself every day now. Don't you agree? Did you think that's what you should do? Even if you give me a task, right? You say Ethan, go do this thing, right? I'm gonna look at it. Is it worth $1,000 an hour? If it's not worth it, find someone else to delegate to. I think my time is worth more, right? I need to focus on things that's worth a lot of money, right? That's why I'm getting this Kev up done. I think it's worth $1,000 an hour, so I'm gonna get it done. That's literally in those excuses. I don't know if it's next week, next week, but then we're gonna start working on Kevork daily now. Every, I don't know, 24 hours, we sit together, we realize something new. I want to actually go out tomorrow, like start talking to people tomorrow, but then if we can't, then we can't, but then, you know, like we gotta get moving, I guess. Like that's really important. Because me sitting here every day working on this thing, it's not gonna generate us money. The only way to generate money is actually talk to customers. And then I go on a source it. I think that's the way to go. But then we're just getting things started, right? So I'm happy to do the first version, but I'm not going to do the second version until we actually get a deal. Like get some kind of interest for other people too, right? So that's how we find product market fit. All right, so that's number one. Number two, I don't say emails need to be done, but just a pain they have to do. And you need to find someone who's very detail oriented to do it. Like it has to be done. Yeah.

SPEAKER 2
Why can't I just get okay, I'll give you an example, right? All my mypack emails are automatically forwarded to my Gmail account.

SPEAKER 1
I know. I know. Because whenever you send an email, I could see you just seizing, seizing yourself, right, from that. So. Okay, question. Have you set up all the dcam, you know, dmark or this kind of, like, dma RC, you know, all this kind of records for my pack domain? Have you set it up?

SPEAKER 2
Yeah.

SPEAKER 1
All right, so if you've set that up, then it's. Just gonna be an email server problem. I don't know. Like you can tell them to do that, right? But then solving this problem is just honestly just get Jaded to solve it, right? Like you're gonna spend a week doing it, just let him spend a week doing it. I don't know.

SPEAKER 2
Tell me like what should I say in terms of the email?

SPEAKER 1
My best recommendation?

SPEAKER 2
Yeah.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, I reckon he can, but then he needs to submit a documentation on his exact plan on doing that. I need to be reviewed by both you and me on how he's going to do backup and set up Microsoft. Like he needs to set up this plan to be reviewed because it's submission critical.

SPEAKER 2
Just the system make it like faster and better because the chances of what he's going to do is not going to be right. Can we just get chat to create that plan?

SPEAKER 1
He should get chat to create what plan for you, but unfortunately I had to do it.

SPEAKER 2
All right, you know what's going to happen, right?

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

SPEAKER 2
You're going to be pretty fast. I mean, if I could just give the thought, the thought.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, I'll have a spec, right? Yeah. All right, then I guess I can just spend 10 minutes setting up the Microsoft subscription for him and we can migrate. But it's going to be up to the holiday, though. Okay.

SPEAKER 2
You can just.

SPEAKER 1
I'll just. I'll just get the spec. I'll just have this back and everything. All right. I'll just have the spec. Yeah, because.

SPEAKER 2
Yeah.

SPEAKER 1
All right, then I think I can do that really fast because I can't. I've done emails, not stuff.

SPEAKER 2
Like, and it just tells him to execute it, and maybe send it to me and I'll send it to you.

SPEAKER 1
Sure. All right, I'll send to you, and I'll have both English and Chinese, and I will just do the best spec I can. I'll do it right now. Like it's actually pretty easy. I'll do it right now. Okay, done.

SPEAKER 2
I think that that's the best way. Yeah.

SPEAKER 1
Because you know what I realized right now? I have too much groundwork to do everywhere. Deploying things. These things are just not worth money. But then I still have to do it, right? I just want to delegate them. Delegate, delegate, delegate.

SPEAKER 2
Right?

SPEAKER 1
Like whatever we do in the future.

SPEAKER 2
Yeah. Can you get a phone to do anything? It's.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, it's exactly what he said. Because I tried. It's just. Yeah, it just turned. Too much. I can't stand it. It's just too many questions and then he stops for no reason.

SPEAKER 2
There's no one that you have there that you can just call.

SPEAKER 1
No, I can't even get them to sign up all the school, literal employer portal, set up account there. I can't even get anyone to do that for me, right? So I don't know. So like I said, I need to disassemble the team for equity, for cash, whatever. We need to get a fucking team. We need to get a good team. Like, I'm not even kidding. We need the best team. Like, we need a set of office exchange. I'm not even kidding. If we want to do everything we're doing, office has to be exchange. Nowhere else. But eventually, right? Not right now, but I'll try to get something remote going. It's only like 90 minutes away. That's right. That's right. But then, yeah, but it's actually finding the people and then, yeah, like, it's really hard. By the way, I did this research, right? I actually did the research. Why? So actually, you know, is the best operating language for LLMs for AI is still actually English today. You know why? Because 80% of all the training materials for GPT Pros or whatever, 80% of training materials are all in English. And you know what's even more shocking? Reddit, which is like training 95% plus, like using a lot of Reddit materials, right? Reddit is just purely in English. There's no Chinese channels, whatever. And majority with the economic journals, even for Chinese universities published ones, they're all in English. And that's what I realized in the future, the best operating language for anyone, like one of the most important skills for anyone, is actually English, believe it or not.

SPEAKER 2
Like, why can't they, why can't they translate it in.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, so why try it, right? You know what's... Yeah, you just lose like 30 to 40% of quality in between. Because the thing with LOM, based on my experience, right, I use it so many hours a day, I know it so well. The more things you give it, the less performant it gets, right? For LOMs, it's always better to be vanilla, basically as little context as possible you inject. Rather than getting into the multi-step thing. Whenever you get into the multi-step thing, the quality goes down. The quality of the intelligence goes down, right? And with ChatGPT thinking, even if you ask a question in Chinese, try with Gemini or whatever, you ask a question in Chinese, and I can actually see the thinking steps are done in English, and then it only gets translated Chinese at the end. That's how the thinking models are working right now. I mean, not for deep-sea, but then for the best Western models. But then deep six is like 20, 30% lagging behind on ChatGPT and probably 50% on GP Pro. Then you realize that the default operating language for best use of LOMs is actually English. And that's, I think, why China is going to fall behind, because all the academic journals or the frontier research, even in Europe, they're all, they all do it in English. And you actually realize English is actually the most important language there is, right? You actually, to be AI native, you actually have to be English native. I don't know if it makes sense or not, right? But then I just have this hypothesis.

SPEAKER 2
I don't understand why can't it, like, you know, I'll give you an example, right? You know how like I have a pump and I put it in through a pump engine and modify this pump. Why wouldn't it be able to do the same thing from Chinese company?

SPEAKER 1
Because all the weightings and everything. Like I said, 80% of training stands for English materials. You can do it in Chinese, but then it's just the weightings are weird. Because when it's processing Chinese, it has a different set of weightings for the language compared to English, right? It's called large language model. Basically, it predicts the next language because 80% training is not in English. It predicts English better than predicting Chinese. That's pretty much the reason.

SPEAKER 2
And that's what, Why wouldn't it translate your thoughts into English to the next generation?

SPEAKER 1
Like I said, it's like you try to talk to everyone in China. Yeah, translation works, but does it work 100%? Because I'm pretty bilingual, right? I know my English is not perfect or anything, but then I know perfectly short. No translator in the world can understand the context 100%. Only after I spoke English for four or five years, I really understood certain things. But then translation will never get to that stage, right? It's always like even for the best level translation is always I think going 60, 70, 80% you would never get 100%. It's not the same. So it's the same thing with AI, I think. Yeah, yeah, because whatever I do in AI, I only want the best, right? Like I'm reimbursing $400 worth of subscription every month from China, US by the way. Because I only want to use the best. I don't care about the second or third. I only care about the best, which is Claude and opening eye right now. And Gemini is falling behind, unfortunately. So it's going to be, I don't know, December, until they launch the new Gemini model. But I only care about the best. And I realized if you really want to use this, because I actually saw on Chinese forums, anyway, yeah, yeah.

SPEAKER 2
If you can do me a favor, or do me a favor, kill yourself, which I think is worth while. Right. That's also to be sure. I mean, there's quite a few episodes. I think there's two seasons.

SPEAKER 1
I think three seasons.

SPEAKER 2
Yeah. Have a look at it. And I love to get your kind of taking it. You know what I mean?

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, sure.

SPEAKER 2
All right. At the same time, I know that you're still doing. I really have to. And then, because I'm pretty clear about my answers to it. I can't think of anything better than that. So I don't really take it away and actually come up with a better answer than that. Sure. Come up with new tactics, do whatever, like, you know, prove me wrong. Like, I'm sure that you can't do something better. Right. Yeah.

SPEAKER 1
Just for myself, right, with my ski set. With what I would do with my ski sets and in America or in China. Like, where would I do it?

SPEAKER 2
Because anyway, anyway, come over here. See? Yeah. What are you gonna do? What's gonna be your strategy?

SPEAKER 1
Right, right.

SPEAKER 2
I'm actually curious to watch because, like, he's making a lot of mistakes right now, and he's like peeing around and stuff like that.

SPEAKER 1
Sure. I have a watch. I have a watch.

SPEAKER 2
You can actually see what he actually, what he's found there, because obviously I'm watching second episode first season. Obviously, as time goes on, people will run and do agree. Right. I just want to come to my heart, and I think that the stuff, like, too, at the end of the last episode, if people are leading to how, I think really making sure, you know, you spread chunk of money now, buying cars cheap. So he's got a ton of cars cheap. He could afford $3,000 and he's trying to put them for, like, you know, two, three thousand.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah.

SPEAKER 2
And, you know, by the time, you know, he's got 10,000, like, you know, back in them doing my, like, the time over. And then, you know, I kind of slipped in. And I think that that's kind of the right thing, the enlightenment. And then you're trying to get enough money to stand with the culture to buy a shooting house, fill it up and ship it. Right.

SPEAKER 1
I don't know, like, you know, these.

SPEAKER 2
Ideas of growing the cars and houses probably work because it's like liquid and, you know, you can actually do all that kind of stuff. Yeah. Yeah.

SPEAKER 1
Have I ever told you I was actually in, in the scrap car business? You know what I did? Like, basically, I had my mating. I used to go to Sydney so often. No, no, I was, I was also doing a scrap car business, right? Because I was going to Sydney Non-Stop back then when I was working at sea quest. I was basically in Sydney like every, I don't know, two weeks every, every month. And then we find this opportunity, right? We can actually, you know, people in Palm Beach, I don't know, somewhere in North Newcastle, they always like have scrap cars they just don't want, they want to get rid of it. And they literally will sell for 100 bucks, whatever. We'll usually drive up there, like I have my mate driving up there, like and tow the car to the scrap yards near Sydney, which is like, I don't know, 50km something drive. You can sell the scrap car for five to six hundred dollars.

SPEAKER 2
Right.

SPEAKER 1
And we're just doing this Non-Stop making five, four, five hundred dollars a day, literally.

SPEAKER 2
Right.

SPEAKER 1
Like, and you just find these people on physical Marketplace. Non-Stop ton of people want to get rid of a scrap car and they don't want to tow their car to scrap yard because in Newcastle, you can't sell your scrap car for more than 200. But you can sell them for 500 near Sydney. So that's what we did. I mean, yeah, but the reason we shut it down, because also, you know, market fund is equilibrium, right? Like all the scrap car, all the Sydney scrap car yards start selling. I start saying, you know, we don't want to take it for 500 anymore. Then the business dies, right? So everything like this just lasts for, for a few months, you know. But anyway, I'll, I'll figure out what's my strategy if I do it now.

SPEAKER 2
But the good thing is, right, the reason why it's going to those, you.

SPEAKER 1
Know, the time limited demand, That's right, that's right, that's right. Like even get, there's definitely more than a thousand cars.

SPEAKER 2
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Put it is though, right? I mean, you know, the thing is keep going into like the big market, which is the other big market, like, you know, but like, I'll give you an example, right? I mean, I don't know, double right there. 100% or say door handles, I don't know people that need door handles. Every day, you know, maybe there's a thousand door handles every day. You know what I mean? You can find the people that need those door handles and you've got to give them, right? But the thing is it's not just going to be cost, you know what I mean? So just got to figure out what it is that it needs to just be a big enough market that we need that business to go into.

SPEAKER 1
So. Yeah, I I agree. But then we're just gonna be market there, right? We can't just be selling.

SPEAKER 2
Yeah.

SPEAKER 1
Hello. Hello. It's weird. I can't hear you. Yeah, I can hear you now. Hello?

SPEAKER 2
Yeah. Yeah. I guess the thing is that, right, is that, you know, the other way around it, right? Like, we're not trying to find first class, dude. Right? If you just go into something that, you know, there's a lot of cities. So, for example, if you have a Toyota Camry, you can collect the white Toyota Camry. Yeah. There's gonna be market for it. Of course.

SPEAKER 1
That's what I had. Yeah, exactly.

SPEAKER 2
I recently sold all my stuff on Facebook Marketplace. I actually figured out what all these things are. They're something that fly at the door and things that just can't sell. You know what I mean?

SPEAKER 1
Yeah.

SPEAKER 2
Generally, which products do he sell? Like, like hotcakes? Hotcakes? For some reason.

SPEAKER 1
Really?

SPEAKER 2
What kind?

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, what kind? Like the, I don't know. I'm just looking at my line, right? Bostons cost 200 bucks a piece. That's crazy. It's just a few pieces of food.

SPEAKER 2
Yeah.

SPEAKER 1
Interesting. All right, I mean, yeah, I'm not.

SPEAKER 2
Selling in, like, 45 feet.

SPEAKER 1
Oh, yeah.

SPEAKER 2
My goodness. I got like a thousand images.

SPEAKER 1
Right. But these things are harder.

SPEAKER 2
Yeah.

SPEAKER 1
TV.

SPEAKER 2
Buster.

SPEAKER 1
I don't know. Coffee machine, blender. I was telling them, too. They were really easy to get rid of.

SPEAKER 2
And. And. And drive.

SPEAKER 1
Oh, yeah, of course. Everyone is a driver.

SPEAKER 2
Yeah. Yeah.

SPEAKER 1
I'm sold over.

SPEAKER 2
Yeah.

SPEAKER 1
Right, right.

SPEAKER 2
Yeah.

SPEAKER 1
But then, honestly, I've sold everything on Facebook Marketplace, man. I look at my physical Marketplace. I've sold over 100 things. All the years when I was in Australia. So I reckon I can sell anything second hand. Like I'm really good at selling second hand shit.

SPEAKER 2
Yeah.

SPEAKER 1
But you know I was into like watches and whatever right? I saw like so many watches as well privately you know. Couple thousand dollar watches.

SPEAKER 2
Yeah. Yeah.

SPEAKER 1
I just, yeah, yeah, I make money from watches and stuff. I used to have what, a few Omega Speedmasters and whatever. I buy a few for like three or four grand. I could sell them for seven, eight hundred thousand, seven, eight thousand dollars, whatever. Selling to rich Asian kids in Melbourne CBD. Like on Marketplace. Yeah, yeah, like I had to find a person and then I know who's a scam, who's not and then I talk to these people. I talked to them about the story, how I owned the watch, how I serviced them, whatever, and I could flip the watch. I used to be really into watches and I could sell watches. But then obviously, you know, watches really died over the last two years too. So anyway, I would just, I saw more than like a couple hundred things on Facebook marketplaces, but they're not like volume stuff. I can't really make serious money with it. So right now I just want to make serious volume of money, right? Spend my time on a thousand dollar activity, right? I tell myself every morning, I only want to spend my time on things that are worth more than a thousand dollars. I don't want to do $10 per hour jobs, right? That's not what I should spend my time on. But anyway, what I would do is I'll have a think about that things when I'm just, I don't know, chilling tomorrow or whatever.

SPEAKER 2
Yeah, sure.

SPEAKER 1
Let me get back to you on the spec for the email migration and then you can You can have a look tour and send the JIRA to execute and let me work on Kevolve right now.

SPEAKER 2
I also message you about this email thing. Yeah. Is that hard to do?

SPEAKER 1
No, it's easy to do an MVP, but then the problem is getting the data. What I will need you to do is that what are the actually meaningful question? Like, what are the questions that will actually save you money instead of getting from Lane? Give me these questions. I know.

SPEAKER 2
You know what? I'm thinking. Tell me. Dump in whatever data we have. Like, all the questions about current orders, current pricing, ETA, so everything that.

SPEAKER 1
So basically, I already tried.

SPEAKER 2
Right?

SPEAKER 1
I already tried it for the spec sheet.

SPEAKER 2
I you go. And then all I'll do, and all I'll do then is I'll just mind the questions that people ask it.

SPEAKER 1
Just literally use CLOAKHER to do its own thing. Let CLOAKHER decide what it should do.

SPEAKER 2
And then just dump everything, dump whatever data we have. And then just see what questions and then just mind the questions that people ask. Oh, everyone's asking about guidelines, but we don't have guidelines in there yet. Easy. Do you know what I mean?

SPEAKER 1
Sorry, you mean don't mind the questions from emails or mind the questions from the data?

SPEAKER 2
No, no, no, no. Minor questions from, I don't know what people actually end up asking you. So you can ask any question they want. Basically the internal 32. Yeah.

SPEAKER 1
Do we use it for my pack staff or for your clients?

SPEAKER 2
Yeah.

SPEAKER 1
Okay. Right, right. So what I'm going to do is literally have a bunch of files and just plug clock coding and let clock code answer the question by itself. And then I'll collect all the queries. After two weeks, I'll decide, you know, how do I refine the data? That's it.

SPEAKER 2
And then say, oh, look, you know, it's missing. Everyone's asking, you know, this question is unable to answer.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, but then, like I said, people here have trouble adopting to new services and they're not going to use it.

SPEAKER 2
It's not going to be for internally. It's not going to be for this name for a few years. And Sarah.

SPEAKER 1
So tell me, doing this service, does it add any value? Is it worth $5,000? Because I'm going to spend at least two hours on this, right? To set it up, to set up the web service for it. Is this worth $1,000? Is this going to provide enough value to you guys? Because I don't want to work on things that's not providing enough value.

SPEAKER 2
I'll be honest with you, right? I think that, I think when it's done, okay, I'll give you an example, right? I'm standing in front of the customer all the time. I'm having conversations with customers.

SPEAKER 1
Right, right.

SPEAKER 2
I'm asking you questions live and I have to say, I'll follow that up.

SPEAKER 1
Okay.

SPEAKER 2
I want to be able when I'm in front of a customer. To ask something in real time, asking no questions in real time. And also be able to quote someone in real time. I think that that's super valuable, but in terms of how much value an official say, but, you know, for social I to be able to actually find information in real time, I think it's extremely valuable when you're standing on the front line and you're being able to get real time information.

SPEAKER 1
Okay.

SPEAKER 2
All right. Does that make sense? Okay, when you're selling, it's like, I want same thing about, by the way, like, all right, how much is it? If I go from street and then to three and it's all my double glazing window, I don't want to be able to, like, literally tell them, let me check.

SPEAKER 1
Okay.

SPEAKER 2
You know what I mean? Yeah, it's primarily the sales people.

SPEAKER 1
Well.

SPEAKER 2
If it made one sale, you know, it's worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, you know, essentially, right?

SPEAKER 1
Yeah.

SPEAKER 2
We just say that being five dollars only because of that. No, I mean, the other sale is going to be more.

SPEAKER 1
Okay.

SPEAKER 2
But it's always going to be more powerful for me to be able to give it an answer on the All.

SPEAKER 1
Right, so this is what I'm gonna do, right? I'm gonna do it literally like the focus floor MVP I give you. I'm only gonna build like a super simple interface. You use it. If you don't use it, I'm not gonna bother fucking do anything. Even for this focus floor, you have to use it. I have to see you using it. I can see what you're doing, by the way. And then I'll improve.

SPEAKER 2
Okay. All right.

SPEAKER 1
So let me build this for you and then I'll see you guys using it, all right? Cool, no problem. All right, so what I would do, sure. Okay, I mean, I'll get a link to try for me for alpha, then I'll give you the beta version. It has to be secure, by the way. I don't have a customer. All right, fine. I'll have a password. All right, cool. I mean, I'll spend a couple hours doing that then. I'll get a link to test it before I send to you. So what I would do right now, three things. I'll get the email migration doc. I will get the, I mean, I'll build the, I don't know, whatever we call it, the MyPac support agent next week. And then I'll send you and I'll send you the, I'll do the email migration doc right now. It will take me, I guess, five minutes. I'll send you right now. Sure. Okay.

SPEAKER 2
All right.

SPEAKER 1
No problem. All right, done. Thanks, man.

SPEAKER 2
I think this is a good interface for it. You know what I mean?

SPEAKER 1
Sure.

SPEAKER 2
Speaking about what you're doing. Yeah.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah.

SPEAKER 2
Yeah.

SPEAKER 1
Okay. Sure. Sure. All right. Why not? I. I want to distract myself a little bit away from work as well. But, you know, I think it's really cool because I got two mental models right now. I've got the number one, you know, the five steps from Elon Musk. Simplify all the processes. And number two, they're saying, I don't want to work on anything that's less than a thousand dollars per hour. Right. These are the two new things I've learned recently, and I thought I'll share with you.

SPEAKER 2
Right.

SPEAKER 1
These are. I'm using them every day.

SPEAKER 2
So.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah. Okay.

SPEAKER 2
I just don't know if anyone actually does that, right?

SPEAKER 1
Yeah.

SPEAKER 2
You know what? I just don't have anyone that actually did that. I think with the 90s, you could have an app not in mind. You know, if it's like, you know, this week and then make ten thousand dollars, you focus on, like, ten thousand dollars. You know what I mean? They say, Look, I need to get that 10,000 because I need it for me, you know, for the worries about whatever. And then you focus on making 10,000 that week. And that's the way to think about it. Not just some random, it's going to be worth $1,000 now. It's too easy to justify that. You can justify that in your mind, but like making $10,000 a week is not something that you can justify. You're either going to get it or you're not going to get it. True, true.

SPEAKER 1
True. Because I can be a lawyer and worse than that hour, right? No, but I want to be very disciplined on projects we do as well, right? Because I feel even for the APS, you know, product and scheduling, whatever.

SPEAKER 2
You're gonna know very quickly. Look, you want it. You want it first. And then you've been.

SPEAKER 1
Okay, done, done, done.

SPEAKER 2
You can think. Focus, focus on shit. I have this, I have to get to that number, right? And I'm not going to get it there, so let's dig it. I think that that mindset's right mindset, right? Like, you know, he's obviously focusing on million and 90 days. He's focusing on how to get good. And he's just like, oh, well, you know, to get there, I need to make myself 3,000 3900. I don't care if I'm scrubbing floors. I don't care if I'm eating, I'm like, I'm 7 years old, shitty. Whatever it is I need to do, I need to get that 3300, I need to get that 3300 by the end of this week. If I don't get there, I'm still going to be, you know, then I need to work hard and get experience. Yeah, but he's very clear, like he says, I need to get to that and then I need to speak about a million dollars. Because if you spend really time thinking about the mirror, you'll get nowhere.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Baby steps, right? Focus on baby steps.

SPEAKER 2
I think that's. And I think that that's where you could get caught. You're focusing on a really big picture, but I think you need to think of the small one. Like, you need to.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, because, like this, I can scrap anything.

SPEAKER 2
I can sleep in a concrete floor. That's what I need to do, so I need to get. I need to get the one. Yeah, if I don't get the one, then. Getting on the stage.

SPEAKER 1
Got it.

SPEAKER 2
I think that's a smart more productive mindset. Yeah. You know what I mean, Nathan?

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

SPEAKER 2
Anyway, have a look at it. I don't want to ruin the trip for you guys.

SPEAKER 1
I'll watch it. I'll watch the first episode. Yeah, sure. All right, I'll watch it. All right, you keep watching it.

SPEAKER 2
I mean, you probably watch it on stage if you like, but just.

SPEAKER 1
No, I'll just watch it for fun, I guess. I don't know. Like, I don't know if you have time to watch 16 hours of shows, right? Yeah.

SPEAKER 2
All right.

SPEAKER 1
Okay, cool, man. Yeah, true, true. Okay. All right. So by the way, you should use a focus flow thing. I'm happy to iterate. I mean, making small changes is fine, like the formatting, the template, whatever. But no, I'll record it. But then you actually use it. Do use it. And then in three days time, whatever you're not happy with, I will make a change, right? It's either from change, but then, I don't actually have to use it and then we see how valuable this is for us, right? For my pack or for whatever.

SPEAKER 2
Okay?

SPEAKER 1
All right. Done. Okay.

SPEAKER 2
By the way, when you're watching, I think it's better for you to watch one episode today rather than two. Yeah.

SPEAKER 1
I don't know. Because I'm the kind of person, right? Whatever I learned the previous day, I start using the next day. You know, I'm that kind of person, right? Whatever I learn, I use it immediately.

SPEAKER 2
Better. Yeah, but it's better enough. It's better enough. I think it's more from the.

SPEAKER 1
Sure. I'll watch episode one later.

SPEAKER 2
Yeah.

SPEAKER 1
Okay. All right.

SPEAKER 2
Sounds good.

SPEAKER 1
All right.

SPEAKER 2
All right.

SPEAKER 1
Thanks. I'll send you the. I'll send you the email stuff now. All right, cool. Yeah.
