# FocusFlow

FocusFlow ingests Plaud.ai share links or direct audio URLs, downloads the audio, runs transcription, and generates meeting summaries with GPT. The stack is a single Next.js 15 (App Router) application with the pipeline logic colocated under `lib/`.

## Features

- üéôÔ∏è Plaud.ai link resolution with automatic meeting-date extraction
- üìº Local audio download and optional AssemblyAI transcription
- üß† GPT summaries + auto-generated meeting titles
- üìã Real-time job logs and progress
- üì± Responsive UI designed for desktop + mobile

## Local Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev          # runs Next.js dev server on http://localhost:3000
```

Environment variables:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` *(required for summaries)*
- `OPENAI_BASE_URL` *(optional, defaults to https://api.openai.com)*
- `OPENAI_MODEL` *(optional, defaults to gpt-4)*
- `ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY` *(optional, enables transcription)*
- `DATA_DIR` *(default `./data` locally; set `/data` inside Docker/Dokploy)*

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the values. This same `.env` file can be reused in Dokploy‚Äîjust ensure `DATA_DIR=/data` when running in containers.

## Production Build

```bash
pnpm build        # creates the production build in .next/
```

This produces the Next.js standalone server under `.next/standalone`, which the Docker image copies during the final stage.

## Docker / Dokploy

The repository ships with a multi-stage `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` that:

- Builds the app with pnpm
- Runs the standalone Next.js server on port `8080`
- Mounts `/data` for persistent jobs, transcripts, and downloaded audio
- Mounts `/app/prompts` read-only so prompt tweaks do not require rebuilding

### Quick test

```bash
docker compose build
docker compose up
```

Visit http://localhost:8080 to add a Plaud link. Jobs and files will persist under `data/` between restarts.

### Dokploy checklist

1. Create an app using the repository or Dockerfile.
2. Upload your `.env` (or enter the same variables manually). When using the provided sample, make sure `DATA_DIR=/data`.
3. Attach a persistent volume to `/data` for jobs/files. (Optional: mount `/app/prompts` to override prompts.)
4. Expose port `8080` (or configure Dokploy ingress).
5. Deploy and run a smoke job to confirm end-to-end processing.

## Deployment TL;DR

1. `cp .env.example .env` and fill in keys (`OPENAI_API_KEY` mandatory, set `DATA_DIR=/data` for Docker).
2. `docker compose build && docker compose up -d` to verify locally.
3. In Dokploy, point to this repo/Dockerfile, upload the same `.env`, mount a volume at `/data`, expose port 8080.
4. Deploy and run a Plaud share link as a smoke test.

## Project Layout

```
app/                   # App Router routes & layouts
components/            # UI components
lib/
  pipeline/            # Job queue, Plaud resolver, AI clients
prompts/
  meeting_summary.md   # Summary template
  title_generator.md   # Title template
```

## Customising Prompts

Edit the files in `prompts/` locally. In Docker/Dokploy deployments mount an override directory to `/app/prompts` to change prompts without rebuilding.

## Scripts

- `pnpm dev` ‚Äì run the Next.js dev server
- `pnpm build` ‚Äì generate the production build
- `pnpm start` ‚Äì serve the prebuilt app (`pnpm build` first)
- `pnpm lint` ‚Äì lint with Next.js defaults
- `pnpm type-check` ‚Äì TypeScript project check

## Smoke Test

1. Paste a Plaud share URL (`https://web.plaud.ai/share/...`).
2. Verify the job resolves the correct meeting date and downloads audio.
3. Check the summary and title once GPT finishes.
4. Restart the app ‚Äì the job should still appear thanks to the persisted `/data` volume.
