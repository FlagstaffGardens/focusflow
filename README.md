# FocusFlow

FocusFlow ingests Plaud.ai share links or direct audio URLs, downloads the audio, runs transcription, and generates meeting summaries with GPT. The current stack is Next.js 15 (App Router) with a shared TypeScript pipeline library.

## Features

- üéôÔ∏è Plaud.ai link resolution with automatic meeting-date extraction
- üìº Local audio download and optional AssemblyAI transcription
- üß† GPT summaries + auto-generated meeting titles
- üìã Real-time job logs and progress
- üì± Responsive UI designed for desktop + mobile

## Local Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev          # runs Next.js dev server on http://localhost:3000
```

Environment variables:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` *(required for summaries)*
- `OPENAI_BASE_URL` *(optional, defaults to https://api.openai.com)*
- `OPENAI_MODEL` *(optional, defaults to gpt-4)*
- `ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY` *(optional, enables transcription)*
- `DATA_DIR` *(default `./data` locally; set `/data` inside Docker/Dokploy)*

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the values. This same `.env` file can be reused in Dokploy‚Äîjust ensure `DATA_DIR=/data` when running in containers.

## Production Build

```bash
pnpm -r build     # builds the pipeline package + Next.js app
```

This generates the standalone server under `apps/web/.next/standalone` which the Docker image uses at runtime.

## Docker / Dokploy

The repository ships with a multi-stage `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` that:

- Builds the monorepo with pnpm
- Runs the standalone Next.js server on port `8080`
- Mounts `/data` for persistent jobs, transcripts, and downloaded audio
- Mounts `/app/prompts` read-only so prompt tweaks do not require rebuilding

### Quick test

```bash
docker compose build
docker compose up
```

Visit http://localhost:8080 to add a Plaud link. Jobs and files will persist under `data/` between restarts.

### Dokploy checklist

1. Create an app using the repository or Dockerfile.
2. Upload your `.env` (or enter the same variables manually). When using the provided sample, make sure `DATA_DIR=/data`.
3. Attach a persistent volume to `/data` for jobs/files. (Optional: mount `/app/prompts` to override prompts.)
4. Expose port `8080` (or configure Dokploy ingress).
5. Deploy and run a smoke job to confirm end-to-end processing.

## Deployment TL;DR

1. `cp .env.example .env` and fill in keys (`OPENAI_API_KEY` mandatory, set `DATA_DIR=/data` for Docker).
2. `docker compose build && docker compose up -d` to verify locally.
3. In Dokploy, point to this repo/Dockerfile, upload the same `.env`, mount a volume at `/data`, expose port 8080.
4. Deploy and run a Plaud share link as a smoke test.

## Project Layout

```
apps/
  web/                 # Next.js app (UI + API routes/queue)
packages/
  pipeline/            # Shared TypeScript pipeline logic (Plaud resolver, downloads, AI clients)
prompts/
  meeting_summary.md   # Summary template
  title_generator.md   # Title template
```

## Customising Prompts

Edit the files in `prompts/` locally. In Docker/Dokploy deployments mount an override directory to `/app/prompts` to change prompts without rebuilding.

## Scripts

- `pnpm dev` ‚Äì run the Next.js dev server
- `pnpm -r build` ‚Äì build both the pipeline package and the Next.js app
- `pnpm --filter @focusflow/web start` ‚Äì start the production server (expects prior build)
- `pnpm --filter @focusflow/web type-check` ‚Äì TypeScript check for the app

## Smoke Test

1. Paste a Plaud share URL (`https://web.plaud.ai/share/...`).
2. Verify the job resolves the correct meeting date and downloads audio.
3. Check the summary and title once GPT finishes.
4. Restart the app ‚Äì the job should still appear thanks to the persisted `/data` volume.
