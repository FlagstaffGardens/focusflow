# FocusFlow

FocusFlow ingests Plaud.ai share links or direct audio URLs, downloads the audio, runs transcription, and generates meeting summaries with GPT. The stack is a single Next.js 15 (App Router) application with the pipeline logic colocated under `lib/`.

## Features

- üéôÔ∏è Plaud.ai link resolution with automatic meeting-date extraction
- üìº Local audio download and optional AssemblyAI transcription
- üß† GPT summaries + auto-generated meeting titles
- üìã Real-time job logs and progress
- üì± Responsive UI designed for desktop + mobile

## Local Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev          # runs Next.js dev server on http://localhost:3000
```

Environment variables:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` *(required for summaries)*
- `OPENAI_BASE_URL` *(optional, defaults to https://api.openai.com)*
- `OPENAI_MODEL` *(optional, defaults to gpt-4)*
- `ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY` *(optional, enables transcription)*
- `DATA_DIR` *(default `./data` locally; set `/data` inside Docker/Dokploy)*

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the values. This same `.env` file can be reused in Dokploy‚Äîjust ensure `DATA_DIR=/data` when running in containers.

## Production Build

```bash
pnpm build        # creates the production build in .next/
```

This produces the Next.js standalone server under `.next/standalone`, which the Docker image copies during the final stage.

## Docker / Dokploy

The repository ships with a multi-stage `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` that:

- Builds the app with pnpm
- Runs the standalone Next.js server listening on port `3000`
- Mounts `/data` for persistent jobs, transcripts, and downloaded audio

### Quick test

```bash
docker compose build
docker compose up
```

By default the compose stack exposes port `3000` only inside the container (ideal for Traefik/Dokploy routing). If you want to reach it directly on your machine, add a small override with `ports: ['3000:3000']` when running locally.

### Dokploy checklist

1. Create an app using the repository or Dockerfile.
2. Upload your `.env` (or enter the same variables manually). When using the provided sample, make sure `DATA_DIR=/data`.
3. Attach a persistent volume to `/data` for jobs/files.
4. Route traffic to container port `3000` via Dokploy/Traefik (no host port publish required).
5. Deploy and run a smoke job to confirm end-to-end processing.

## Deployment TL;DR

1. `cp .env.example .env` and fill in keys (`OPENAI_API_KEY` mandatory, set `DATA_DIR=/data` for Docker).
2. `docker compose build && docker compose up -d` to verify locally.
3. In Dokploy, point to this repo/Dockerfile, upload the same `.env`, mount a volume at `/data`, and configure ingress to target container port 3000.
4. Deploy and run a Plaud share link as a smoke test.

## Project Layout

```
app/                   # App Router routes & layouts
components/            # UI components
lib/
  pipeline/            # Job queue, Plaud resolver, AI clients
prompts/
  meeting_summary.md   # Summary template
  title_generator.md   # Title template
```

## Customising Prompts

Edit the files in `prompts/` locally. They are baked into the image; if you need runtime overrides you can still mount a directory to `/app/prompts`, but it‚Äôs optional.

## Scripts

- `pnpm dev` ‚Äì run the Next.js dev server
- `pnpm build` ‚Äì generate the production build
- `pnpm start` ‚Äì serve the prebuilt app (`pnpm build` first)
- `pnpm lint` ‚Äì lint with Next.js defaults
- `pnpm type-check` ‚Äì TypeScript project check

## Smoke Test

1. Paste a Plaud share URL (`https://web.plaud.ai/share/...`).
2. Verify the job resolves the correct meeting date and downloads audio.
3. Check the summary and title once GPT finishes.
4. Restart the app ‚Äì the job should still appear thanks to the persisted `/data` volume.
